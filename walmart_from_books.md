## Sam Walton: Made In America
- First few chapters:
  - Sam Walton was apparently the best negotiator, a great salesman, a motivator, 
  - The best way to reduce paying estate taxes is to give your assets away before they appreciate
  - Student/Campus leadership secrets - Speak to the person coming down the sidewalk before they speak to you
  - You can learn from everybody, start experimenting, **learn from your competitor**, have little capacity for embarrassment
  - And like most other overnight successes, it was about 20 yrs in the making.
  - Almost everything they had done was copied from somebody else. Improve something everyday, he is less afriad of being wrong than anyone else,
  - Walmart in boucing back days - buy it low, stack it high, sell it cheap!
  - Sam Walton - In the community, he is an establishment kind of giu.. but in the marketplace - he has always been a maverick who enjoys shaking things up and creating a little anarchy.
  - Many of the opportunities were created out of necessity
  - He thought about merchandising all the time, 24x7, most of his adult life
  - Saturday morning meetings - bring all store managers together, show results, everyone tells what's best selling in their stores - diffuse information fast and regularly, let everyone know what mistakes they made so that you can share lessons learned.
  - bedrock values - a belief in the importance of hard work, honesty, neigbhourlinessm and thrift.
  - He wanted to learn about IBM computers, so he enrolled in a course about it.
  - Sam Walton fought on technology expenditures as hard as he could but Walmart couldn't have scaled without computers.
  - He bought airplaces to be able to commute quickly to stores.
  - Management style - pick good people, give them maximum authority and responsibility. Play by his strengths and rely on others to make up for his weaknessess. Also, a haphard style of management; he things being organized would slow him down. Except for reading his numbers on Saturday morning and going to his regular meetings, he didn't have a routine. He had a tape recorder for taking his notes; his yellow pad with 10-15 top things he thinks the company needs to work on. Management style by wearing down - keep repeating your point until someone finally agrees to do it, always looked over other people's shoulder. He didn't have a lot of patience. 
  - SW was unpredictable, independent thinker.
  - He really believed in the profit-sharing plan; he gave folks responsibility, trusted them, and then checked on them.
  - He thought that everyone needs as much exposure to as many areas of the company as they can get; best executives are ones who have touched all the bases and have the best over all concept of the corporation.
  - Share info, lighten the mood, rally the troops
- How to compete with Walmart?
  - Do your own thing better than Walmart does theirs; avoid going at them head-on
  - Add a personal touch | greet them, get on the floor (like many indie stores these days)
  - Offer higher quality + community events that go with them.
  - Speicialize in a product segment e.g hardware stores. Develop a uniqueness, a niche, and then you catpitalize on it
- Meeting the competition / Expanding circles
  - look at what everyone else is doing, taking the best of it, and then making it better
  - what'-if game with numbers and then let the gut make the final decision. but it could be wrong
  - One he has decided he is wrong, then he is ready to move on to the next problem/approach
  - They have their own private fleet of truck, they had satellites (faster movement of info; and thus quicker decision making - what we all do today = information is power)
- Thinking small as you grow
  - Think one store at a time = keep lowering prices, keep improving service, and making things better for the folks who shop in the stores. Saturday morning meetings for retrospectives (no centralization / streamlining really), no vendor lock-in
  - Communicate, Communicate, Communicate - spread information across the company quickly
  - Keep Your Ear to the Ground
  - Push Responsibility -- and Authority -- Down
  - Force Ideas to Bubble Up
  - Stay Lean, Fight Bureaucracy | egos have no place in Wal-Mart
- 10 Rules that worked for Sam Walton
  - COMMIT to your business
  - SHARE your profits with all your associates, and treat them
  - MOTIVATE your partners
  - COMMUNICATE everything you possibly can to your partners
  - APPRECIATE everything your associates do for the business
  - CELEBRATE your success. Find some humor in failures, don't take yourself too seriously, loosen up, and everybody around you will loosen up, have fun.. show enthusiasm, always
  - LISTEN to everyone in your company
  - EXCEED customer expectations
  - CONTROL your expenses better than your competition. this is where you can find competitive advantage :/
  - SWIM upstream. Go the other way. Ignore the conventional wisdom. If everybody else is doing it one way, there's good chance you can find a nice by going in exactly in the opposite direction
  - You cannot keep doing what works one time, because everything around you is always changing. To succeed, you have to stay out in front of that change. To succeed, you have to always keep changing.
 
If I had wanted to reach the goals I set for myself, I had to get at it, and stay at it everyday. I had to think about it all the time.
