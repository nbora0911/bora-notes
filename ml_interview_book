- In fact, several hiring managers have told me that they’d rather hire people who are great engineers but don’t know much ML because it’s easier for great engineers to pick up ML than for ML experts to pick up good engineering practices. 🌳 Tip 🌳 If you’re a candidate trying to decide between software engineering and ML, choose engineering.

##### Application companies vs tooling companies
  - 🌳 Tip 🌳 If you're unsure whether the role involves working with an application or a tool, here are a few questions you may ask.
   - Who are the main users of your product?
   - What are the use cases you're targeting?
   - How many people does your company have? How many are engineers? How many are in sales?

##### Enterprise vs Consumer Company
- 🌳 Tip 🌳
Since these two types of companies have different business models, they need to be evaluated differently when you consider joining them.

For enterprise products, you might want to ask:

- How many customers do they have? What's the customer growth rate (e.g. do they sign on a customer every month)?
- How long is their sales cycle (e.g. how long it usually takes them from talking to a potential customer to closing the contract)?
- How does their pricing structure work?
- How hard is it to integrate their product with their customers' systems?

For consumer products, you might want to ask:

- How many active users do they have? What's their user growth rate?
- How much does it cost to acquire a user? This is extremely important since the cost of user acquisition has been hailed as a startup killer15.
- Do users pay to use the product? If not, how are they going to make money?
- What privacy measures do they take when handling users' data? 




You’d think that when companies hire, they know exactly what they want their new hires to do. Unless it’s an established team with routine tasks, hiring managers can seldom predict with perfect clarity what tasks need to get done or what skills are needed. Sometimes, companies can’t even be sure that they’ll need that person. Sam Altman, chairman of the startup accelerator Y Combinator and co-chairman of OpenAI, advises companies that, in the beginning, “you should only hire when you desperately need to.”
