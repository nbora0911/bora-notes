## Scatterfocus 

- Mind wandering
- Collecting and connecting dots
- It lets one
  -  set intentions and plan for the future
  -  lets you recharge
  -  fosters creativity
- The more creativity your job requires, the more you should deliberately deploy scatterfocus
- When your mind wanders, it visits three main places 
  - past (12% - out of this we spend <20% thinking of anything before day before yday),
  - present (28%), and 
  - future 48% - of this we spend 80+% of time planning today and tomorrow's activities. lol
- Scatterfocus between tasks rather than indulging in distractions

Three types of scatter focus
- Catpure mode 
   - let you mind roam freely and capture whatever bubbles up; 
   - best for identifying what's on your mind
   - can use everyday // set timer for 10 mins// and list everythng that's on your mind
- Problem crunching mode 
   - holding a problem loosely in mind and letting your thoughts wander around it; 
   - best for mulling over a specific problem
   - use sparingly // save for the largest problems you're processing
   - for 30 or 60 mins at a time
- Habitual mode 
   - engaging in a simple task and capturing the valuable ideas and plans that rise to the surface while doing it = this is the most powerful; 
   - best for recharging and connecting the greatest number of ideas
   - the happier you are in scatterfocus mode, the more benefits you will reap. An elevated mood actually expands the size of your attentional space
   - How to enter in this mode? Pick something you enjoy doing; the simpler the better. Going on a walk; riding a bike; good ideas will rise to the surface as long as you have attention to spare
   - Frequently check what thoughts and ideas are in your attentional space
 - Burnout = never giving our attentional space a rest.

- Recharging
 - The more often we scatterfocus to replenish our mental energy, the more energy we have for our most important tasks
 - The better rested we are, the more productive we become. 
 - Refreshing breaks = something pleasurably effortless = low-effort and habitual, something you actually want to do; and something that isn't a chore (unless you love it)
   - spending time in nature is the best activity 
 - How often? Research says
   - Take a break atleast every ninety minutes
   - Break for roughly fifteen minutes for each hour of the work you do?! this feels too much break
- For every hour of sleep you miss, you lose two hours of productivity the next day. // have a night time ritual to ensure you go to bed in time everyday

- Connecting dots
  - The better you remember a complex problem, the greater your odds of coming up with a creative solution
  - The richer the enviornment, and the richer our experiences, the more insights we're able to unearth. 
  1. Scatter your attention in a richer environment // rich environment = constantly encountering new people, ideas, and insights // deliberately expose yourself to new cues. 
  2. Write out the problems you are trying to crack
     - Regularly reviewing these problems and the document itself kept the project fresh in my mind.
     - Make an outline of how you will solve a problem // writing a thesis / remodeling stuff// getting a new roommate etc
     - Write down three next-day intentions at the end of the workday ;; and the largest problems you are in the middle of processing
     - Write down which is the first problem you are going to solve tomorrow and how you are going to do it.. and next day will start with a productive action
  3. Sleep on a problem
     - never go to sleep without a request on your mind
  4. Take a step back
     - Purposefully delaying creative decisions can help you connect dots... Finish your work before the deadline but let it marinate in your head.
  5. Intentionally leave tasks unfinished 
  6. Consume more valuable dots

- Collecting dots
  - We are what we pay attention to
  - Valuable dots are both useful and entertaining; useful dots stay relevant for a long time; they are actionable; related to what you have consumed beforehand or completely unrelated; do you think your life will be different knowning this piece of information?
  1. Consume things you care about, especially when few others do. 
     - Double down on developing skills and knowlegde that you find entertaining.. and in the medium you prefer
  2.
