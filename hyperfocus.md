## Scatterfocus 

- Mind wandering
- Collecting and connecting dots
- It lets one
  -  set intentions and plan for the future
  -  lets you recharge
  -  fosters creativity
- The more creativity your job requires, the more you should deliberately deploy scatterfocus
- When your mind wanders, it visits three main places 
  - past (12% - out of this we spend <20% thinking of anything before day before yday),
  - present (28%), and 
  - future 48% - of this we spend 80+% of time planning today and tomorrow's activities. lol
- Scatterfocus between tasks rather than indulging in distractions

Three types of scatter focus
- Catpure mode 
   - let you mind roam freely and capture whatever bubbles up; 
   - best for identifying what's on your mind
   - can use everyday // set timer for 10 mins// and list everythng that's on your mind
- Problem crunching mode 
   - holding a problem loosely in mind and letting your thoughts wander around it; 
   - best for mulling over a specific problem
   - use sparingly // save for the largest problems you're processing
   - for 30 or 60 mins at a time
- Habitual mode 
   - engaging in a simple task and capturing the valuable ideas and plans that rise to the surface while doing it = this is the most powerful; 
   - best for recharging and connecting the greatest number of ideas
   - the happier you are in scatterfocus mode, the more benefits you will reap. An elevated mood actually expands the size of your attentional space
   - How to enter in this mode? Pick something you enjoy doing; the simpler the better. Going on a walk; riding a bike; good ideas will rise to the surface as long as you have attention to spare
   - Frequently check what thoughts and ideas are in your attentional space
 - Burnout = never giving our attentional space a rest.

- Recharging
 - The more often we scatterfocus to replenish our mental energy, the more energy we have for our most important tasks
 - The better rested we are, the more productive we become. 
 - Refreshing breaks = something pleasurably effortless = low-effort and habitual, something you actually want to do; and something that isn't a chore (unless you love it)
   - spending time in nature is the best activity 
 - How often? Research says
   - Take a break atleast every ninety minutes
   - Break for roughly fifteen minutes for each hour of the work you do?! this feels too much break
- For every hour of sleep you miss, you lose two hours of productivity the next day. // have a night time ritual to ensure you go to bed in time everyday

- Connecting dots
  - The better you remember a complex problem, the greater your odds of coming up with a creative solution
  - The richer the enviornment, and the richer our experiences, the more insights we're able to unearth. 
  1. Scatter your attention in a richer environment // rich environment = constantly encountering new people, ideas, and insights // deliberately expose yourself to new cues. 
  2. Write out the problems you are trying to crack.
