Six Questions to Determine Whether a Company Is Product-Led
1. Who came up with the last feature or product idea you built?

  If I ask a product manager this question, I hope to see a look of confusion on his or her face. “What do you mean who came up with it? Well, our team did. Right? That’s how it normally works.” This kind of response is a sign of a healthy product management organization, in which management sets the goals and the team is given room to figure out how to reach them. The product manager should be leading the charge to discover user problems and to solve them. This doesn’t mean that an important initiative or solution idea can’t come from management every once in a while, but that should be the exception, not the rule.
  
  It’s a huge red flag when a team not only can’t take ownership for what it is building, but can’t even tell me why it is building it. This means that the originator of the idea never connected the why to the what.

1. What was the last product you decided to kill?
   
  Another sign of an unhealthy product management culture is the inability to kill a product or idea that will not help a company reach its goals. If you hear, “We never really kill anything,” it often means that there’s a pretty big problem.
  
  Typically, this happens for one of the following reasons:
  
  The organization already committed the idea to customers. Often, someone from marketing has promised a client that a particular feature is in the works and then the company feels committed to fully follow through with it. It doesn’t matter whether the client actually requested it or whether it achieves any of the organization’s desired goals.
  
  Budgeting can’t budge. In some large organizations, in which the budget is set at the beginning of the year, the team must spend all of it or else it will not receive an equally large budget the following year. This concept is baffling, but it happens.
  
  No pushback to management. Again, a lack of testing and questioning potential features signifies a lack of empowerment in a team. If a team doesn’t feel like it is safe to say to management, “Hey, that thing we tested, well, it doesn’t work and we don’t think it’s worth the money to build it,” the chances of a successful environment for product management are slim.

1. When’s the last time you talked with your customers?
   
  What I dread hearing is, “Oh, well, management doesn’t really let us talk to customers. They’re worried about us annoying them too much.”
  
  Without a healthy dialogue between a company and its customers, there is no way to truly learn about what the customers want or need. An organization set up for success not only allows product managers to talk to customers, it encourages them to do so and recognizes this process as a huge part of the job. In fact, your interviewee should be probing you for clues that you are comfortable talking to customers and that you aren’t planning to spend all your time safely indoors writing user stories.

1. What is your goal?
   
  This is the first question I ask any product manager during an interview process.1 If the product manager cannot articulate a clear goal, it’s a sign of poor product management at the organizational level. If the product manager does have a goal but it is more output centric than outcome focused, this also signifies an unhealthy product team. An output-centric team measures success in terms of meeting product shipment deadlines. It pays little attention to what these products are actually doing for its business.
  
  The purpose of a product manager is to create value for the business by creating value for the customer. If the product manager does not understand the vision of the company, how are they supposed to figure out how to get there? Goals should be outcome oriented, actionable, and clearly communicated throughout the organization.

1. What are you currently working on?
   
  A truly successful product manager talks more passionately about the problems the product development team is solving than the solutions they are shipping. This is one of the biggest signs of success, for me, and it goes hand-in-hand with the question of goals. When I ask product managers this question, I want to hear about what big problems they are tackling for the user and the business. Of course, they will talk about the solution, as well, but more in the context of what it will do to help solve their problems. If this mindset is encouraged throughout the organization, you can hear it echoed at all levels.

1. What are your product managers like?
   
  As product managers, we want to work in an organization where the role is respected and well regarded. I’ve seen many organizations where the product management function was not well-respected. There were two causes: product managers were either seen as too strong, or they were seen as too weak.

  In the first instance, product managers were seen as dictators who threw out requirements to the team rather than involving them in their decision-making process. The teams grew resentful and felt they were treated as resources rather than as colleagues. A good product manager knows that getting buy-in from the whole team is crucial. The product manager is not the only person who should be coming up with the ideas but should instead be harnessing their team’s full capacity. A sign of a healthy product team is hearing development and UX people say, “I love my product manager. She has clear direction, communicates well, and helps keep us stay focused on the goals and problems.”
  
  In the second instance, product managers are seen as weak in the organization because they are beaten down by stakeholders2 and management. When product managers are seen as project managers, they hold no decision-making power. Stakeholders and management use them to just usher their own ideas through. Product managers don’t feel like they can say no because of the potential for strong backlash.
  
  The dream organization for product people is one that sees product managers as leaders who help shape the direction of the company and the services they provide to their customers. They are respected as partners in steering the ship forward. These six questions can help you to ensure that the company you are in—​or want to join—​will support and encourage you to do everything you can to succeed.
