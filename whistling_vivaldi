** Whistling Vivaldi - How stereotypes affects us and what we can do**
We are all stereotyped in some way or the other. It is not just about the minorities but everyone. However, some groups face is more than others. This is possibly why focusing on minorities first can be a 80/20 approach. 

### What is the problem exactly?
The chief discovery of this book is that protective side of the human character can be aroused by the mere prospect of being negatively stereotyped, and that, once aroused, it steps in and takes over the capacities of the person - to such an extent that little capacity if left over for the work at hand. (please read this again, think of that time when you were trying to prove that you don't fit the stereotype... it was stressful, wasn't it?)

### Policy implications?
Executive Summary: Psychological Safe spaces: Unless you make people feel safe from the risk of these identity predicaments in identity-integrated settings, you won't succeed in reducing group achievement gaps or in enabling people form different backgrounds to work comfortably and well together. 

### Practical findings:
1. By changing the way you give critical feedback, you can dramatically improve minority students' motivation and receptiveness. 
Is the feedback based on the quality or their work or on negative stereotypes about their group's abilities? [Study] What kind of feedback worked? > The feedback giver explained that he "used high standards"  in evaluating the essays for publication in the teaching magazine. Still, he said, having read the students' essay, he believed the student could meet those standards. Why did this work?  It told them they weren't seen in terms of the bad stereotype about their groups' intellectual abilities, since the feedback giver used high intellectual standards and believed they could meet them. -- demand a lot, but believe that they can meet those demands --

2. By improving a group's critical mass in a setting, you can improve its members' trust, comfort, and performance in the setting. - this is a no brainer - Think of the times when having someone similar like you in a place has put you at ease, and think of times when there many of them like you.

3. By simply fostering intergroup conversations among students from different backgrounds, you can improve minority students' comfort and grades in a setting.

4. By allowing students, especially minority students, to affirm their most valued send of self, you can improve their grades, even for a long time. 
- What are the two or three of your important values? Why are they important to you? OR Why did you do today that you are proud of? why? #google's iamremarkable sessions
Positivity fosters positivity.. we often try to fix our weaknesses(opportunities) but our real opportunities are our strengths and positively re-affirming them. 

5. By helping students develop a narrative about the setting that explains their frustrations while projecting positive engagement and success in the setting, you can greatly improve their sense of belonging and achievement - which if done at a critical time could redirect the course of their lives
 

Random observations: Notes:
- Ask for help, collaborate, what are you talking about at a happy hour, in a relaxed conversation: Page 103: Saw black students - in an effort to succeed where their ability are negatively stereotyped, following a strategy of intense, isolated effort, a strategy that often set them up for defeats and discouragements. They were trying hard, they were trying to do it all by themselves, in a class where other people were working more happily and efficiently together, pooling their intellectual success. : Over-efforting
