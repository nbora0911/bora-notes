### Work on what matters:
1. Avoid Snacking = Avoid low impact, low effort work
2. Stop preening = Low impact, high visibility work
3. Stop chasing ghosts = low impact, high effort work // like a  new leader immediately changing the org strategy because they have to do something
4. Existential issues
5. Work where there's room and  attention:
       - Most effective places to work are those that matter to your company but still have enough room to actually do work. What are priorities that will become critical in the future, where you can do great work ahead of time? What are areas that are doing ok but could be doing great with your support?
       - Examples - developer tooling, inclusion work, glue work. // but people don't care, then what to do?
       - Sometimes an area that an organization doesn't pay attention to is so important that you're going to wamt to advocate for it to start paying attention. This is the hardest thing to do and so, balance efforts vs time here
7. Foster growth: invest in hiring; investing onboarding, mentoring, and coaching. re: learning sessions
8. Edit: Quick modifications to projects (scoping down, consensus, etc) can make a project be in limbo vs successful. Focus here; low effort, easy, and high impact... and visible
9. Finish things: Special editing = finishing a project. We only get value from finished projects, and getting a project over the finish line is the magical moment it goes from risk to leverage.
10. What only you can: things that simply won't happen if you don't do the, are your biggest opportunities. Intersection of you what you are exceptionally good at and what you genuinely care about.
11. Why it matters: Only viable long term bet on your career: focus on work that matters, do projects that develop you, and steer towards companies that value genuine experience.
