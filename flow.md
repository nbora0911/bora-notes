# What is flow? 
An experience when you forget time, you are just focused on the task at hand, you forget about self.
Optimal experience is an end in itself. 
## Commonalities in activities that people "enjoy"
1. Confronting tasks that we have a chance of completing.
2. Must be able to concentrate on what we are doing.
3. Task undertaken has clear goals 
4. Provides immediate feedback
5. One acts with a deep but effortless involvement that removes from awareness the worries and frustrations of everyday life
  Loss of consciousness of self
6. Control: Allows people to excercise a sense of control over their actions
7. Sense of duration of time is altered. 

### Family Context of experiencing optimal experience
1. Clarity - goals and feedback are unambiguous
2. Centering - children's perception that parents are interested in what they are doing
3. Choice - children feel that they have a variety of possibilities to choose from, including breaking parental rules - as long as they are prepared to face consequences
4. Commitment - trust that allows child to feel comfortable enough to set aside the shield of his/her defenses
5. Challenge - parent's dedication to providing increasingly complex tasks - identifying the right balance

### Random lines:
- From "Man's Search for Meaning" - The most important trait of survivors is a "nonself-conscious individualism" - a strongly directed purpose that is not self-seeking.
- Body in flow - yoga/rock climbing/dancing, joy of music, sex as flow, joy of movement, joy of tasting, joys of seeing, 
- Flow of thought - Wonder is the reflection of the purest form of pleasure, science, poetry, riddles, loving wisdom, 
- Work as flow
  Experiments show that people tend to be in a flow state more at work than when they are at leisure. Even then, people want more leisure than work.
  - Set the challenge of reaching one's goals while helping the bosses and colleagues reach theirs.
  - Waste of free time - The future will belong not only to the educated person, but to the one who is educated to use their leisure wisely" - C. K. Brightbill
- Solitude and other people: A person who rarely gets bored, who does not constantly need a favorable external environment to enjoy the moment, has passed the test for having achieved creative life"
- Cicero once wrote that to be completely free one must become a slave to a set of laws. In other words, accepting limitations is liberating. 
- Differentiation and integration
  Differentiate - grow individualy
  Integration - grow with the surroundings
  
#### Transforming chaos
  1. Unselfconscious self-assurance
    You know you don't have enough resources, but instead of fight against the environment, you decide to function harmoniously within it. 
  2. Focusing attention on the world
    Moving your focus from inward to the surroundings. If one continues to stay in touch with what is going on, new possibilities are likely to emerge, which in turn might suggest new responses, and one is less likely to be entirely cut off from the stream of life. 
  3. The discovery of new solutions:
    - stick to the goals, remove the obstacles and charge ahead
    - if there are too many obstacles, maybe you need to redefine the goals
    
#### Making of Meaning
  - Commmitment to a goal and to the rules it entials is much easier when the choices are few and clear
  - Activity and reflection should ideally complement and support each other. Before investing great amounts of energy in a goal, it pays to raise the fundamental questions:
    1. Is this something I really want to do?
    2. Is it something I enjoy doing?
    3. Am I likely to enjoy it in the foreseeable future?
    4. Is the price I - and others -will have to pay worth it?
    5. Will I be able to live with myself if I accomplish it?
    
  - If goals are well chosen, and if we have the courage to abide by them despite opposition, we shall be so focused on the actions and events around us that we won't have the time to be unhappy. And then we shall directly feel a sense of order in the wrap and the woof of life that fits every thought and emotion into a harmonious whole. 
  
#### Developing the concept of self
1. Differentiation: Focus on self - survival
2. Integration: Focus on community - family, friends, etc
3. Differentiation: Reflective individualism - growth/development/actualization of potential
4. Integration: Turning away from self, back towards an integration with other people and with universal values
5. Extremely individualized person willingly merges their interests with those of a larger whole
