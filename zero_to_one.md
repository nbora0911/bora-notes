### Zero to One: Notes on Start Ups, or How to Build the Future 
Author - Peter Thiel

What important truth do very few people agree with you on?

Lessons from the dot-com bubble:
- Make Incremental advances
- Stay Lean and flexible
- Improve on the competition
- Focus on product, not sales

All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition. 

Winning is better than losing but everybody loses when the war isn't one worth fighting. If you can't beat a rival, it is better to merge. 

A great company is defined by its ability to generate cash flow in the future. 

##### Characteristics of a Monopoly:
1. Proprietary Technology
    - 10X better than the rival. 
2. Network Effecs
    - the product must be valuable to its very first users when the network is necessarily small
3. Economies of Scale
4. Branding
    - No technology can be built on branding alone (Yahoo because cool but no tech >> didn't work)

##### Building a Monopoly:
1. Start Small and Monopolize
    - Every monopoly dominates a large share of its market. So, every startup should start with a very small market. 
2. Scaling Up
    - The most successful companies make the core progression - to first dominate a specific niche and then scale to adjacent market 
3. Don't Disrupt
    - As you craft a plan to expand to adjacent markets, doon't disrupt; avoid competition as much as possible
4. The Last will be the first
    - you must study the endgame before everything else. Make the last biggest development in a specific market and then enjoy years of monopoly profits
