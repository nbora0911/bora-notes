### Zero to One: Notes on Start Ups, or How to Build the Future 
Author - Peter Thiel

What important truth do very few people agree with you on?

Lessons from the dot-com bubble:
- Make Incremental advances
- Stay Lean and flexible
- Improve on the competition
- Focus on product, not sales

All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition. 

Winning is better than losing but everybody loses when the war isn't one worth fighting. If you can't beat a rival, it is better to merge. 

A great company is defined by its ability to generate cash flow in the future. 

##### Characteristics of a Monopoly:
1. Proprietary Technology
    - 10X better than the rival. 
2. Network Effecs
    - the product must be valuable to its very first users when the network is necessarily small
3. Economies of Scale
4. Branding
    - No technology can be built on branding alone (Yahoo because cool but no tech >> didn't work)

##### Building a Monopoly:
1. Start Small and Monopolize
    - Every monopoly dominates a large share of its market. So, every startup should start with a very small market. 
2. Scaling Up
    - The most successful companies make the core progression - to first dominate a specific niche and then scale to adjacent market 
3. Don't Disrupt
    - As you craft a plan to expand to adjacent markets, doon't disrupt; avoid competition as much as possible
4. The Last will be the first
    - you must study the endgame before everything else. Make the last biggest development in a specific market and then enjoy years of monopoly profits
    

###### Chapter 6 - You are not a lottery ticket:
- Longer term planning - intelligent design - you are not a lottery ticket

###### Chapter 7 - Follow the Money:
- Money makes money
- Pareto Principle: 80-20 rule, 20% of the peapods in the garden produced 80% of the peas
- Power Law: Small handful on companiesvradically outperform all others
- The biggest secret in venture capital is that the best investment in a succesful fund equals or outperforms the entire rest of the fund combined - every single company in a good venture portfolio must have the potential to succeed at vast scale
- Rules for VCs: 
    1. Only invest in companies that have the potential to return the value of the entire fund
    2. Do not break rule number 1
- VCs must find the handful of companies that will sccessfully go from 0 to 1 and back them with every resource.
- The reason people do not see the power law: In the beginning all the companies in the fund look similar. VC investment in a long term game. You see some differences in companies at mid-fund level, and only in mature funds will you see stark differences in companies as successes and failures. *LONG TERM GAME* 
- You should focus relentlessly on something you're good at doing, but before that you must think hard about whether it will be valuable in the future. 
- By power law, not advisable to start a company?? page 91
- If you do star a company: Most important things are singular
     1. One market will probably be better than all others
     2. One distritution strategy usually dominates all others
     3. Time and decision making follow a power law: Some moments are far more important than others - Remember Tennis
     4. Don't forget the power law
 ###### Chapter 8: Secrets
 
 - Why do we not believe in secrets anymore? 
     1. Incrementalism
     2. Risk Aversion
     3. Complacency
     4. Flatness - Globalization
- How to find secrets?
     Two types of secrets: nature and people.
