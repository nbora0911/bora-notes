### Zero to One: Notes on Start Ups, or How to Build the Future 
Author - Peter Thiel

What important truth do very few people agree with you on?

Lessons from the dot-com bubble:
- Make Incremental advances
- Stay Lean and flexible
- Improve on the competition
- Focus on product, not sales

All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition. 

Winning is better than losing but everybody loses when the war isn't one worth fighting. If you can't beat a rival, it is better to merge. 

A great company is defined by its ability to generate cash flow in the future. 

##### Characteristics of a Monopoly:
1. Proprietary Technology
    - 10X better than the rival. 
2. Network Effecs
    - the product must be valuable to its very first users when the network is necessarily small
3. Economies of Scale
4. Branding
    - No technology can be built on branding alone (Yahoo because cool but no tech >> didn't work)

##### Building a Monopoly:
1. Start Small and Monopolize
    - Every monopoly dominates a large share of its market. So, every startup should start with a very small market. 
2. Scaling Up
    - The most successful companies make the core progression - to first dominate a specific niche and then scale to adjacent market 
3. Don't Disrupt
    - As you craft a plan to expand to adjacent markets, doon't disrupt; avoid competition as much as possible
4. The Last will be the first
    - you must study the endgame before everything else. Make the last biggest development in a specific market and then enjoy years of monopoly profits
    

##### Chapter 6 - You are not a lottery ticket:
- Longer term planning - intelligent design - you are not a lottery ticket

##### Chapter 7 - Follow the Money:
- Money makes money
- Pareto Principle: 80-20 rule, 20% of the peapods in the garden produced 80% of the peas
- Power Law: Small handful on companiesvradically outperform all others
- The biggest secret in venture capital is that the best investment in a succesful fund equals or outperforms the entire rest of the fund combined - every single company in a good venture portfolio must have the potential to succeed at vast scale
- Rules for VCs: 
    1. Only invest in companies that have the potential to return the value of the entire fund
    2. Do not break rule number 1
- VCs must find the handful of companies that will sccessfully go from 0 to 1 and back them with every resource.
- The reason people do not see the power law: In the beginning all the companies in the fund look similar. VC investment in a long term game. You see some differences in companies at mid-fund level, and only in mature funds will you see stark differences in companies as successes and failures. *LONG TERM GAME* 
- You should focus relentlessly on something you're good at doing, but before that you must think hard about whether it will be valuable in the future. 
- By power law, not advisable to start a company?? page 91
- If you do star a company: Most important things are singular
     1. One market will probably be better than all others
     2. One distritution strategy usually dominates all others
     3. Time and decision making follow a power law: Some moments are far more important than others - Remember Tennis
     4. Don't forget the power law
 ##### Chapter 8: Secrets
 
 - Why do we not believe in secrets anymore? 
     1. Incrementalism
     2. Risk Aversion
     3. Complacency
     4. Flatness - Globalization
- How to find secrets?
     Two types of secrets: nature and people. 

##### Chapter 9: Foundations:

- Thiel's Law: a start upmessed up at its foundation cannot be fixed 
- Size of the board: If you want to want an effective board, keep it small - (3-5)
- In no case should a CEO of an early stage, venture-backed startup recieve more than $150k per year in salary. Set the tone for the rest of the company
- Any kind of cash is more about the present than the future. So, give equity over cash.
- Opennes to invention

##### Chapter 10: Mechanics of a Mafia:
- Why should a recruit join your company? General distinguishing answers
    - Answers about your company's mission

- Silicon Valley Hoodies: 
    - From the outside, everyone in your company should be different in the same way.
    - From the inside, every individual should be sharply distinguished by their work.
- Eliminating competition makes it easier to build the kind of friendships that transcends professionalism

##### Chapter 11: If you build it, will they come?
- Being a Salesman: If there is not money, it doesn't work. So, not matter how big genuises you have in your company or the product, you need to sell it.
- Sales is Hidden: Salesman's priority is persuasion, not sincerity
- Two metrics for effection distribution: CLV < CAC
    1. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
    2. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- Power law of Distribution: If you can get one channel of distribution working, you have a great business. Try many but don't nail a single one -> you are done!

##### Chapter 12: Man and machine!
- AI will not leave us jobless. 
- Tech is complementary to humans.. it aides us,not replaces us.

##### Chapter 13: Seeing Green
- Failure of cleantech startup, and why Tesla succeeded? 
- Seven Question every business must answer: 
    1. The Engineering Question:
       Can you create beakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements? -> atleast 10X improvement
       
    2. The Timing Question:
        Is now the right time to start your particular business? ->
    3. The Monopoly Question:
        Are you starting with a big share of a small market? -> Define your market well > can you monopolize?
    4. The People Question:
        Do you have the right team? -> Apparently, never invest in a CEO that wears a suit? Really?
    5. The Distribution Question:
        Do you have a way to not only create but deliver your product?
    6. The Durability Question:
        Will the market be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future? -> Every entreprenuer should plan to be the last mover in her particular market. 
    7. The Secret Question:
        Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don't see?
       
##### Chapter 14: Founder's paradox
- Extreme personalities
- Founders are important not because they are the only ones who work has value, but rather a great founder can bring out the best work from everybody at their company.
