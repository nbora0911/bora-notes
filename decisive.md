This book lays out reasons why people may end up making bad decisions and how one can try to avoid traps that lead to these sub-optimal or just bad decisions. 
### Reasons for making bad decisions 
1. Not considering multiple options or Narrow framing ---> Widen your options
2. Confirmation Bias ---> Reality test your assumptions
4. Short-term emotion.----> Attain distance before deciding
5. Overconfidence -----> Prepare to be Wrong

#### Widen your options:
- Red flag in decision making > whether I should do X or not? If you are trying to answer this, then rest assured you are trapped in a narrow frame.
- Instead of thinking "This or that" think "this **AND** that"?
- Think about opportunity cost
- Vanishing Options test: What if your current options disappeared?
- Try to get real alternatives - not one that are obviously bad to make a single one look good. 

Multiracking
- Consider multiple options at once instead of being squential. This helps one get the general shape of the problem.
- It keeps egos in check. If I have only one option, my entire self worth/ ego is attached to it.
- Searching for hires/house: keep searching for options until you fall in love at least twice.
