This book lays out reasons why people may end up making bad decisions and how one can try to avoid traps that lead to these sub-optimal or just bad decisions. 
### Reasons for making bad decisions 
1. Not considering multiple options or Narrow framing ---> Widen your options
2. Confirmation Bias ---> Reality test your assumptions
4. Short-term emotion.----> Attain distance before deciding
5. Overconfidence -----> Prepare to be Wrong

#### Widen your options:
- Red flag in decision making > whether I should do X or not? If you are trying to answer this, then rest assured you are trapped in a narrow frame.
- Instead of thinking "This or that" think "this **AND** that"?
- Think about opportunity cost
- Vanishing Options test: What if your current options disappeared?


Multiracking
- Consider multiple options in parallel instead of being squential. This helps one get the general shape of the problem.
- Try to get real alternatives - not one that are obviously bad to make a single one look good.   
  - You don't need 12+ options to get drastic improvement, **you rather need 2 or more legit alternatives instead of one**.. Having too many options can lead to choice fatigue (reasons why you hate shopping!)
- It **keeps egos in check**. If I have only one option, my entire self worth/ ego is attached to it. Having multiple options takes care of this attachment. 
 - High involvement, low attachment > ++
- Searching for hires/house: keep searching for options until you fall in love at least twice.
- Two mindsets:
  - Prevention focus -> Avoid negative outcomes
  - Promotion focus -> Pursue positive outcomes
  the idea is to blend the both while making decisions (obviously!) lol

Find someone who has solved your problem
- Look at yourself: Have you solved this problem before? Have you solved a similar problem before? After there general trends in how you have succefully solved problems in different areas that you can apply here?
- Look around yourself: Friends/family/team. 
- Look outside: competitive analysis, benchmarking, best practices
- To be proactive, encode your greatest hits in a decision "playlist"
  - Do not understand this :(. What's the difference between a playlist and checklist?
- Looking for ideas in the distance: Ladder up via analogies:
  - being interdisciplinary 

#### Reality-test your assumptions
If we did follow the first section, we might have a couple of legit alternatives to solve our problem. However, confirmation bias can skew out assessment of these options. So, this section deals about combating confirmation bias. 

Consider the opposite
- To make good decisions, CEOs need the courage to seek out disagreements
- Disagreeing Agreeably or Constructively > Disagreements can get to egos/politics and thus, beat the purpose of testing our assumptions. To solve for this, reframe how you ask the questions. Take each option, and ask the group > "What would have to be true for this option to be the right answer?"
  I find this question very very hard. 
- Asking probing questions (I always do this)
  - Caution: can backfire in a power dynamic situation
- Extreme disconfirmation: Assuming positive intent and keep a marriage diary
- Making deliberate mistakes to test your core assumptions

Zoom out, Zoom In
- Outside view: In general, people (including experts) do not do well at predictions but they are good at base rates. If you need trustworthy information, go find an expert - someone more experienced that you. Just keep talking about the past and the present, not the future. 
  - It is humble approach to ask, "What can I reasonably expect to happen if I make this choice". Once we accept the answer - and trust it to make our decision - *then* we can turn our attention to fighting the odds.
- Inside View: To fight the odds, you need to become specific - get closer look for more color and texture of this particular problem. 
  - In my profession, this translates to looking at the data. Data is King, it provides the intuition and base rates.  
- Best info > outside view + close up

Ooch
- Ooching is producing a prototype/ MVP etc, testing etc. Why predict when we can test? Why guess when we can know?
- If you can test, there is no need to hypothesize. Ooching - a way of discovering reality than predicting it.
  - Executives: To the extent we can predict the future, we can control it.
  - Entrepreneurs: To the extent that we can control the future, we do not need to predict it. - folks favor testing.
- Ooching is best for situations where we genuinely need more information and not recommended for cases that require full commitment. 
- 
Random: In financial institutions, first line/ second line inherently act to fight against confirmation bias -> reasons why they probably do well. They have to do it because of regulations. In non-financial institution, one could do this by having teams review other teams work. This is very similar to within a team - PR reviews. This may need to be top-down priority
