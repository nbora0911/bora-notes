Growth mindset: insatiable curiosity and deep pure desire to learn
Setting high standards, and having extremely safe and nurturing environment?
they need to love the process of effort: try things, new strategies, ask people for help!
  
Quotes:
- In my family, to be good is to fail. To be very good is to fail.. The only thing _not_ a failure is to be great."
- p177: You know, in France, when they're nice to you, you feel like you've passed a test. But in Italy, there is no test : Giulia (Italian) is great example of this. To add to this, in America, even if they are nice to you; you know they don't mean it. "Bless their heart... blah blah.. " LOL

  
- For kids (and for anyone really), keep away from a certain kind of praise - the praise that judges their intelligence or talent or praise that implies that we're proud of them for their intelligence or talent.
- Praise should deal, not with the child's personality attributes, but with his efforts and achievements". Praise them for the growth oriented process - what they accomplished through practice, study, persistence, and good strategies. 
- p184 example - summary: When there is failure, it works better to be honest about the situation; emphathize and then focus on what they need to do achieve what they want to. So, to say "you didn't deserve it" is better than responses that criticize the system; people; are consolations. 
  
  
  
  
  P.S:
This is a long book explaining the same concept over and over again. It felt a bit repetitive; and annoyed me by the end of it. I also feel that hit too close to heart. Growing up or even in college; labels were extremely common; effort was looked down upon; natural talent was always rewarded. Fixed mindset, in way can be relieveing - you have it or not; but growth mindset implies you are responsible if you don't succeed because it always about effort. There are two ways of looking at it.. and right not, just effort for all my life feels very burdensome.
