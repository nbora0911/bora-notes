Whichever risk controls an organization implements, they’ll need to be paired with strong governance and **policies for the people** that build and maintain ML systems.

### Legal and Regulatory Landscape
1. [EU AI Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/) - especially Annexes 1 and 3–8,
2. [Federal Reserve’s SR 11-7 guidance](https://www.fdic.gov/news/financial-institution-letters/2017/fil17022a.pdf) : pay special attention to the focus on cultural and organizational structures. Managing technology risks is often more about people than anything else.
3. [Washington DC’s proposed Stop Discrimination by Algorithms Act](https://dcchamber.org/algorithms-act/) attempts to replicate federal expectations for nondiscrimination and transparency, but for a much broader set of applications, for companies that operate in DC or use the data of many DC citizens.
4. Basic Product Liability: The Hand rule says that a product maker takes on a burden of care, and that the resources expended on that care should always be greater than the cost of a likely incident involving the product. 
5. In “Aiming for Truth, Fairness, and Equity in Your Company’s Use of AI,” the FTC states, “Hold yourself accountable—or be ready for the FTC to do it for you”
