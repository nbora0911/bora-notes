1. Difference between PCA vs tSNE vs UMAP
2. Imbalanced class - how to solve it
3. Initializing weights for NNs
4. Scaling features - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/standardscaler-minmaxscaler-and-robustscaler-techniques-ml/
5. Bias / Variance trade off
6. Explain p-value in simple terms
7. Explain gradient boosting trees to someone who knows basics of decision trees and graduate level statistics
8. Explain gradient descent
9. Explain RAG - how do you minimize hallucinations, how do you ensure quality of retrieved context; what are other challenges with RAG.; questions on segmenting documents
10. In a modeling pipeline, how did you many sure your model was following all the model governances laws (data, pipeline, etc)
11. How did you do feature selection (re: alps model)? correlation matrix, rfe, etc?
12. How did you ensure training efficiency? (poorly worded questions - they wanted to know about valdiation - OOT, Mature OOT, OOA)
13. ALPSish
    a. What was the business problem?
    b. How did you decided the target variable?
    c. What were the business metrics to evaluate the model?
    d. How did you decide on model design? / what factors were considered?
    e. 

## ZocDoc
- Round 1 - simple sql
- Round 2 - ML: find area/perimeter of a circle with simulation; why is cross-entropy used as a loss function, bias-variance trade off;
- System Design - design autocomplete system; got grilled on logistic regression; AB testing - statistical power etc
# Uber
- ML Coding round: what is k-means, implement k-means, how would you implement convergence, why is convergence necessary, let's say you had a class of students and everyone scored >95 points. What will happens with k-means (unstable solution)
