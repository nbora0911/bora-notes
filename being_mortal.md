Well being is about the reasons one wishes to live. Those reasons that matter not just at the end of life, or when debility comes, but all along the way. Whenever serious sickness or injury strikes and your body or mind breaks down, the vital questions are the same: 
1. What is your understanding of the situation and its potential outcomes?
1. What are your fears and what are your hopes?
1. What are the trade-offs you are willing to make and not willing to make?
1. What is the course of action that best serves this understanding?


Courage is __strength__ in the face of knowledge of what is to be feared or hoped. Wisdom is prudent strength. Atleast two kinds of courage required in aging and sickness. 
1. The courage to confront reality of mortality
1. The courage to act on the truth we find. Here, the fundamental challenge is to decide whether one's fears or one's hopes are what should matter most. 

If end-of-life discussions were an experimental drug, the FDA would approve it. [Study](https://www.massgeneral.org/cancer-center/clinician-resources/advances/the-meaningful-benefits-of-early-palliative-care-for-advanced-cancer) shows those who saw a palliative care specialist stopped chemotherapy sooner, entered hospice far earlier, experienced less suffering at the end of their lives - and they lived 25 percent longer.

One looks for a certain kind of autonomy. The autonomy to write the story of ones own life, in whatever small way one can. The story is ever changing. Over the course of our lives, we may encounter unimaginable difficulties. Our concerns and desires may shift. But whatever happens, we want to retain the freedom to shape our lives in wats consistent with our character and loyalties. The battle of being mortal is the battle to maintain the integrity of one's life - to avoid becoming so diminished or dissipated or subjugated that who you are becomes disconnected from who you were or who you want to be. 

Falls are the ones that lead to eventual downfall of a person in old age. Don't let the old one fall, that's the key :D

Where the old live? > Home, nursing home, assisted living, hospice
