## From Tanya/ Morning Pages
- Activity is to write down 3 pages every morning. long form.
- Takes between 20 - 40 mins. So, get up earlier than usual. Make it a morning routine
- Do it before you check your phone, internet, news, or anything.
- Make it a ritual // make it exciting // have coffee? right after shower. simple, easy to do, calming
- Buy nice supplies. A good book, a good pen. smooth ink. Don't use supplies that you hate //
- Go outside or open a window
- Don't worry about your handwriting // doesn't have to be legible
- Don't worry about grammar or spelling or anything .. just write
- Don't worry about having complete thoughts // jump from one to other // just follow your thoughts or stream of consciousness
- Listen to ad-free ambient music
- Don't let anyone interrupt your writing
- Meditate before writing for 5 mins // center yourself / just breathing and stuff
- if you are not a morning person, write it at night / sometime
- don't censor yourself
- destroy your morning pages if you are worried about privacy
- allow room for mistakes // it is okay if you miss a day or so
-
