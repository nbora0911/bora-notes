- there is a change in the protagonist; 
- audience should like the protagonist
- there are stakes; and they get higher

#### Homework 1: 
Watch Ahsok's story: https://youtu.be/uheFFuDdn4g
  - While watching Ashok's story, try to answer these questions:
  - What does the storyteller want and why? 
  - What is in the way of the storyteller getting/achieving what they desire? 
  - Are you invested in the storyteller’s journey? Why or why not?
  - Do you feel as though you are experiencing events as they unfold? Explain. 
  - Pick a pop culture reference like Back to the Future and practice mapping out the beats of the story using the Arc Diagram.

#### Homework 2:
Please have One story that you are leaning toward and two backup story ideas for our session.  Also, have a Desire, 3 Obstacles and a Resolution for each of the 3 stories. 

When working on your story, ask yourself: 
- What do I want and why? 
- What is in the way of me getting/achieving what I want? 
- Will the audience be invested in the storyteller’s journey? Why? 
- What characters in my story can I bring to life and “let speak”? Where can I add dialogue between me and other characters? 
- What are the scenes in the story? Am I painting a picture? 
- Am I sharing my reactions and feelings throughout?

I have attached the story prompts worksheet and I encourage you to also refer to the Story Arc to assist you.

#### Story prompts
- I reall wanted .. because .. when I did or did not get/achieve it, I felt .. and since then (or because of that)..

#### Exercises that I remember from class:
- Tell your story in 30secs, 1 min, 2 mins. - helps in getting clarity on your main points
- Always start your story with a scene
- Show, don't tell
- Take each section of the story and elaborate on it -- with details.. and then cut it down
- Minimize setup and resolution
- Enjoy it
- Put the reps in; and then emotions; and pauses; delivery
- Random warm up exercises - rant for a minute
- Use words for expressing emotions
- Have another character in your story // depict them with a different voice or a gesture or something
- At this point you need to get started “getting your reps in.” In the end, you want your story to be natural, familiar and almost automatic. When I am preparing for a performance I will tell my story to myself in the mirror, to a friend or family member and even to complete strangers!   My secret weapon is the voice memo app on my phone. 




#### Advice from ChatGPT for Moth Storytelling:

The Moth is a non-profit organization that presents live storytelling events, where people come together to share true, personal stories from their lives. If you want to tell a story at one of their events, here are some tips and tricks that may help:

1. Start with a strong opening that will grab the audience's attention and set the tone for your story. You could begin with a striking image, a thought-provoking question, or a surprising revelation.

2. Keep your story focused and concise. The Moth typically limits stories to 5-8 minutes in length, so make sure you choose a single, compelling event or idea to focus on. Avoid rambling or digressing from the main point of your story.

3. Use concrete details and sensory language to paint a vivid picture for the audience. Instead of simply saying "I was scared," describe the physical sensations you felt, the sights and sounds around you, and the emotions that were racing through your mind.

4. Practice your story out loud to find the right pacing and rhythm. Pay attention to how your words sound and how they flow together, and try to create a natural, conversational tone.

5. Tell your story with passion and authenticity. The Moth is all about real, personal stories, so don't be afraid to let your emotions show and to be vulnerable in front of the audience. Let your story come from the heart and speak to the human experience.
