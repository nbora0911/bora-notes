Good writing is simple and should follow all the rules of grammar:
- Write in complete sentences and mostly, in the active voice
- Attain subject/verb agreement
- Use the correct tense
- Put the modifiers in the proper place
- Use punctuation correctly

General tips
- Make only one point per paragraph
- In each section of your document, put your bottom line up front
- In each section,, describe what you did, how you did it, and why you did it
    - Use simple words and short, simple sentences, and present your information in a logical way
- Simplify, Simplify, Simplify. Writing is hard work. A clear sentence is no accident - William Zinnser “On Writing Well”
- Choose unemotional words as you write
    - Don’t use something like “bad data”.. no one knows what that means - probable incomplete/ inadequate/erroneous
- Active Vs Passive Voice
    - Determine where you want the focus to be.
        - Active voice - who did something is emphasized
        - Passive voice - when you don’t care who did it but care about the what
- Keep your writing concise, clear, and simple
- Avoid using the word “this” or “it” without a specific reference - it’s too vague. Use specific nouns instead
