## Spark
- Periods of transition - at any age - have been opportunities to make friends
- Gotta put in the face time to make friends
- All significant friendships are founded on some serious time together
- In friendship, there are magic numbers too like in skill development: 30hrs (casual friends), 50 hrs (friends), 140 hrs (good friendship), and 300 hrs (best friend)
  - 300hrs ~ 12.5 days - just a little longer than a typical honeymoon.
- In the first year of friendship, couch time was essential.
## Shine Theory
- I don't shine if you don't shine
- People who are unafraid to share their knowledge and resources with other in their community are the most likely to succeed over the long haul
- One of the most helpful things we can do for someone is to connect them to someone else. 
- If we turn down an opportunity, we make a point of recommending someone else in our network.
- Shine theory goes hand in hand with transparency,because you cannot level up if you don't have a sense of where you rank. 
- Strategy in Obama's office: If one woman spoke up, another would repeat her point and make sure to say her name to give credit where was due. The women got themselves heard because they formed a strategic, united front. 

- The stretch - challenging and taking efforts to be with your friend when things are not easy
- Talk about stuff if things feel off
## 
- Interracial relationships tend to end sooner than same race relationships if it's the only interacial relationship for one or both parties
- Accountability question in mixed race friendships: Would I be able to look my Black friend in the eye and describe how I handled this situation?
## Too Big to Fail
-  society don't expect friendships to go through a break up or not big enough to warrant attention// so, friendship breakups can be harder than any other break ups
-  they knew things were not working, they didn't know how to get through to each other; they went to a therapist // that helped me bridge the connection
## For the long haul
- 4 burners of life : family, friends, health, and work (i don't agree with the following but let's write it down anyway)
  - your stove cannot run long if you have all burners on
  - to be successful, you have to switch off one burner
  - to be really successful, you have to pick just two to keep lit
- Loneliness and weak social connections are associated with a reduction in life span similar to that caused by smoking 15 cigarettes a day
- One of the patients' to five regrets was that they hadn't stayed in touch with their friends.
- Staying attached to a close friend can be boiled down to three main things:
  - ritual - yearly trips / holidays / celebrating a day together / we need commemorative experiences together
  - assurances - find verbal and non-verbal ways to tell each other you plan to be there in the future
  - openness/transparency - the need for transparency arises when there is stretch / strain because of a change that's affecting the friendship
