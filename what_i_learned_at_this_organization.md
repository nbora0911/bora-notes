- Commuication, influence, network, understanding culture is as valuable if not more in getting shit done technical expertise
- Coaching me - I learn by seeing them how my mentor/coach think / how they make decisions/ what is your process of solving a problem
- Relationships matter a lot - having recurrent catch ups is very helpful to keep your network alive. Help people.
- Capital One had courses (to learn about Credit, Technology, Leadership skills, etc) was very helpful in understanding the larger system
- Mentors and mentorship programs // up, down, sideways
- David - don't forget the do nothing option // pragmatically find a way out of any problem // be transparent in your decision making to gain credibility // iterate by getting feedback from all across
- When anyone asks a question, the presenter or answerer is encouraged to ensure they understand the question -> or maybe even ask the question behind the question. Understanding the question // intent has helped in answering the actual question on a person's mind. At other places, I have noticed that poeple quickly jump into giving many details /ansering the question without understanding the question. It infuriates me.
