### Getting Ready 

### Why dating is harder than ever before?
  - “We define our own identities, unlike our ancestors, whose lives were defined by - their communities.
  - We have thousands of options at our fingertips, which causes us to question our decisions.
  - We’re uncomfortable making big decisions when we can’t research our way to the right answer.
  - Social media leads us to believe that everyone else is in healthier, happier relationships than we are.
  - Far too few of us have good relationship role models.
     "Study after study demonstrates the power of role models. It’s much easier to believe something is possible when you’ve seen someone else do it, whether that’s running a four-minute mile or eating seventy-three hot dogs in under ten minutes (#lifegoals). For example, **women are much more likely to become inventors if they grew up in a zip code with many female patent holders**. In fact, they’re more likely to patent in the same categories as older female inventors in their neighborhood"
        - We need relationship role models too. “How do healthy couples resolve conflict? How do happy spouses make decisions together? How do you successfully spend the rest of your life with one person?”
  - There are far more models for dating and long-term relationships.
  - We’re bombarded with messaging that we need to get this decision “right”—and that a right answer exists at all.”
  - “Using insights from behavioral science, we can take control of our love lives.”

#### The Three Dating Tendencies  
  - Take the test.
  - “Many people suffer from dating blind spots—patterns of behavior that hold them back from finding love, but which they can’t identify on their own.
-  The Three Dating Tendencies. Each group struggles with unrealistic expectations.
     - The Romanticizer has unrealistic expectations of relationships. They want the soul mate, the happily ever after—the whole fairy tale.
          - “Our mindset matters! The ability to shift your mindset from **soul mate to work-it-out beliefs**” 
          - “People with a work-it-out mindset know that relationships take effort and that building a successful relationship is a process”
     - The Maximizer has unrealistic expectations of their partner. They love to explore their options and want to feel absolutely confident they’re making the right decision.
        - “Maximizers obsess over making the best possible decision.”
        - Satisficers “They know their criteria, and they hunt until they find the “good enough” option”
        - The Secretary problem
            - “There are a hundred possible candidates whom you must interview one by one. You should interview 37 percent of the candidates and then pause. Identify the best person from this first group. Now you have a meaningful benchmark. After evaluating the first 37 percent, you should be prepared to hire the first candidate who is better than the standout from the first group.”
            - “Assuming that his search would run from ages eighteen to forty, the 37% rule gave age 26.1 as the point at which to switch from looking to leaping.“That means that by the age of 26.1, he should set a meaningful benchmark from his first 8.1 years of dating—that is, the single best person he’s dated thus far. He should then marry the next person he meets whom he likes more than that benchmark.”
     - The Hesitater has unrealistic expectations of themselves. They feel like they’re not ready to date.
         - STOP TALKING TO YOUR EX
           
#### Learn your attachment style 
  - Look for a secure partner
  - Learn to self-regulate—managing disruptive impulses and emotions.
#### LOOK FOR A LIFE PARTNER, NOT A PROM DATE
